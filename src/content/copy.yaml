    content: |
      HECS (Higher Education Contribution Scheme) and HELP (Higher Education Loan Program) are government loans for university study.
      
      **How it impacts your retirement:**
      • Repayments are automatically deducted from your salary by the ATO
      • Reduces your take-home pay and available investing funds
      • Higher earners pay more (up to 10% of income for high salaries)
      • No interest charged, but indexed annually to inflation
      
      **We calculate this for you:** Based on your salary, we'll automatically work out your repayment percentage and reduce your available investing money accordingly.

  # Contextual help and tips
  tips:
    earlyRepayment: |
      **Tip:** You can make voluntary repayments to your HECS/HELP debt to reduce it faster. 
      However, consider whether this money might earn better returns if invested instead, 
      especially since HECS/HELP only charges inflation (not compound interest).
    
    salaryPackaging: |
      **Note:** Salary packaging can reduce your HECS/HELP repayments by lowering your 
      reportable income. This might free up more money for retirement investing.
    
    highEarners: |
      **High earners:** With salaries over $131,989, you'll pay the maximum 10% HECS rate. 
      This significantly impacts your available investing funds - our calculator accounts for this.

    summary: "Why is rent treated differently in retirement planning?"
    content: |
      **Rent vs. other expenses in retirement:**
      • Most Australians aim to own their home by retirement age
      • Rent payments typically stop when you retire (no ongoing mortgage/rent)
      • Other living expenses (food, utilities, healthcare) continue throughout retirement
      
      **How this affects your planning:**
      • We calculate your retirement needs based on expenses that will continue
      • Your current rent helps us understand your total budget today
      • In retirement, this money could go toward other expenses or lifestyle choices
      
      **If you plan to keep renting:** You can adjust this in the advanced settings to include ongoing housing costs in retirement.
  
  # Rent vs mortgage explanation

  # Tips and contextual help
  tips:
    firstHomeBuyer: |
      **First home buyer?** Consider our Property Calculator to explore home buying options. 
      Owning a home by retirement eliminates ongoing housing costs.
    
    investmentProperty: |
      **Investment properties:** If your rent is partially offset by investment property 
      income, you can adjust this in the advanced expense breakdown.
    
    retirementHousing: |
      **Retirement housing options:** Many retirees downsize or move to areas with 
      lower living costs. Our default assumes minimal housing costs in retirement.

  # HEM explanation and disclosure
  disclosure:
    summary: "What is HEM and how can it help my retirement planning?"
    content: |
      **Household Expenditure Measure (HEM)** is used by Australian banks and financial planners to estimate typical household spending.
      
      **Based on real Australian data:**
      • Developed from Australian Bureau of Statistics spending surveys
      • Updated regularly to reflect current living costs
      • Includes essentials like food, utilities, transport, and modest discretionary spending
      • Used by banks for home loan assessments and by Centrelink for pension calculations
      
      **How it helps you:**
      • Provides a realistic baseline if you're unsure about your expenses
      • Based on what similar Australian households actually spend
      • Excludes housing costs (rent/mortgage) as these vary significantly
      • Conservative estimates - you may spend less or more depending on lifestyle

  # Tips and warnings
  tips:
    personalisation: |
      **Remember:** HEM provides average spending amounts. Review each category and adjust 
      based on your actual lifestyle and spending patterns for more accurate results.
    
    exclusions: |
      **Not included in HEM:** Rent/mortgage payments, investment contributions, 
      debt repayments, and major one-off purchases. These are calculated separately.
    
    conservative: |
      **Conservative estimates:** HEM amounts represent modest but adequate spending. 
      If you have a higher lifestyle, increase the relevant categories accordingly.

      **Investment priority order:**
      1. **Emergency fund** - 3-6 months of expenses in a high-interest savings account
      2. **High-interest debt** - Pay off credit cards and personal loans first (usually 15-25% interest)
      3. **Super contributions** - Contribute at least the minimum, consider salary sacrificing for tax benefits
      4. **Investment property or shares** - Build wealth through capital growth and income
      
      **Getting the balance right:**
      • Start with small, consistent amounts (even $50/week makes a difference)
      • Gradually increase investments as your income grows
      • Don't over-extend - leave room for unexpected expenses
      • Review and adjust every 6-12 months as your situation changes
