## Australian Financial Terminology Guidelines

### Superannuation Terms

- "Super balance" not "account balance" or "super balance"
- "Super fund" not "superannuation fund"

### Age Pension Language
- "Age Pension" (capitalized) to match government usage
- "Pension payment" not "pension benefit"
- "Assets test" and "income test" (lowercase)
- "Centrelink" when referring to the agency specifically
- "Services Australia" for broader government service references

### Financial Planning Terms
- "Retirement planning" not "financial planning" (more specific)
- "Take-home pay" not "net income" (clearer for users)  
- "Living expenses" not "expenditure" (more accessible)
- "Investment returns" not "portfolio performance" (clearer)
- "Retirement income" not "pension income" (broader concept)
